# Ariadne - Mapping Financial Regulation

### Ariadne provides unique visibility of regulatory compliance

- Visualised
- Connected
- Curated

### The Ariadne system gives users a dynamic, graphic representation of the relationship between:

- processes / controls 
- regulations / policies and 
- organisation structure / roles

### This is applicable in the present, past and future:

- In the present (management of the Compliance environment)
- In the past (to meet the requirements of regulators and auditors) 
- In the future (to scenario plan the impact of future regulatory, process or organisational change)
