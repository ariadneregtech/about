# Ariadne - Mapping Financial Regulation

Ariadne is a Regulatory and Compliance Management product which tackles the problems of the complexity and cost of compliance and assists enterprises to reduce the risks of non-compliance. Using powerful visualization methods it links all aspects of the compliance universe – people and organisation, regulations and policies and processes and controls – into a coherent picture which evolves as the environment changes. 
It also provides a method of capturing evidence of compliance and allows reconstruction of past states and modelling of future scenarios and allows reviews and other events to be scheduled for future action.

### Ariadne provides unique visibility of regulatory compliance through:

- Visualisation
- Connectedness
- Curation

### The Ariadne system gives users a dynamic, graphic representation of the relationship between:

- processes / controls 
- regulations / policies and 
- organisation structure / roles

### This is applicable in the present, past and future:

- In the present (management of the Compliance environment)
- In the past (to meet the requirements of regulators and auditors) 
- In the future (to scenario plan the impact of future regulatory, process or organisational change)
